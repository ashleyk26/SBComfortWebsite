                <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
                <p>SB Comfort Detailing started in June 2023. It started as a small idea between two high schoolers. Us, Scott Kulcsar and Boden Gagne, were talking on the way home from a hike. Boden asked how to detail his grandfather's mustang. Scott gave him a few tips and even offered his help, as Scott was currently working as a boat detailer at Silver Sands Marina. Even prior to this, he has detailed cars his whole life. One of Scott's greatest passions is not only building cars and trucks but keeping them clean and looking pretty! Scott had said that he had been thinking about starting a detailing business. That's when the idea took flight. From that night on, they worked day and night. Putting in countless hours of work from planning out the business to working on advertising and finally scoring their first couple of details. SB Comfort Detailing has since then hired on more people to help with the rising workload, as they offer high quality work for less than the competition and are slowly working their way to be the #1 detailer in Gilford! 
                
                SB Comfort Detailing means more to us than just making profit though. SB Comfort Detailing represents the friendship between us, Scott and Boden, and the fact that we were able to build a company together based on drive and motivation. Our goal is to build a company that is able to compete with the biggest detailers in Gilford, while also providing a work environment for our employees that not only is productive but enjoyable and opens up opportunities in the future. Book your appointment to help two high schoolers' dreams come true!

                <h2>Business Specifics</h2>
                <p>SB Comfort Detailing always use's name brand products. I'm not talking about those chemicals that you see all over Instagram and Tik Tok. I'm talking about products from very highly rated and well known companies such as Griots and Mothers. These products are then applied to the many different packages we offer. These packages range from our base package which mainly focuses on cleaning your car to our high end packages which not only cleans your car but protects it from the elements! We also offer a custom package, which is where you are able to personally choose which services you would and would not like. These packages are viewable under the Book Session page, along with them also being in the forms. We are able to detail almost anything that has a motor attached to it! Some of the vehicles we detail are Cars, Motorcycles, Boats, Waverunners, RV's, Snowmobiles, 4 Wheelers, Side by Sides, and more. Email us if you have any questions on what we detail or if you have a question on a different kind of vehicle not listed that you would like to have detailed.</p>
